Disclaimer: the author is neither an NMR spectroscopist, nor a software engineer. I'm figuring this out as I go along. I welcome feedback on the project. If you think the simulation or the code could be improved upon, feel free to leave an issue on GitHub, or contact me by email (see setup.py for my current address).
