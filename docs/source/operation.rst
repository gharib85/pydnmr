Entering Parameters
-------------------

Numerical values can be entered into the fields at the top of the application
window. The calculations assume units of Hz for chemical shifts, or s\
:superscript:`-1` for rate constants. Relative populations of sites are
entered as percentages.

Mouse Controls
--------------

Clicking on the up/down arrows, or scrolling with the mouse wheel
while the field's contents are active, raises/lowers the values inside in
increments of 1.

Inside the plot of the spectrum:

* Left click and drag moves the plot.

* Scroll up/down zooms in/out.

* Right click and drag expands/contracts the spectrum horizontally/vertically.

* Right click currently opens up menus of options that have not been fully tested yet. These options are built into the third-party pyqtgraph library that pyDNMR imports.
