Qt Creator's Designer module was used to cobble together the first GUI for
pyDNMR. The contents of this folder are the Qt Creator files and several
versions of GUIs produced with it (ending in .ui).

At the time of writing, most clear guides/tutorials still used PyQt4, which has
major differences from PyQt5--in particular, the implementation of "signals
and slots". The combination of QT Creator and pyuic5 was helpful in the early
stages of the project to understand the new syntax as well as construct a
functional GUI.

The .ui files are converted to python/PyQt5 vie the command line:

    pyuic5 -x guiname.ui -o guiname.py

and substituting the guiname with the names of the target/destination files.


mainwindow was the first attempt at the GUI, but the lack of clear widget
names resulted in an eyesore.

mainwindow_named gave names to the widgets within Qt Composer, that were
copied over into the final python version. This was expanded upon to result
in the first functional GUI.

mainwindow_signal_socket_tets added an undesired signal/slot link to see
where pyuic5/Qt thought .connect statements "belong" in the code. It was only
 used as a learning aid.
