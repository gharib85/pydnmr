A list of steps I took to get PyInstaller to freeze pydnmr on my macs with the
 Anaconda install.

* jinja2 was downgraded to 2.8.1:
    conda install jinja2=2.8.1

    Apparently 2.9 added something for Python 3.6. The error doesn't occur in
     3.6--but PyInstaller doesn't work past 3.5.


* got rid of mkl support with numpy etc:
     conda install nomkl

* I restored my anaconda installation, and tried the above in a new conda
environment, but wasn't getting it to work. I tried, on my desktop mac, the
following and then was able to freeze with pyinstaller:
    conda install nomkl numpy scipy scikit-learn numexpr
    conda remove mkl mkl-service
