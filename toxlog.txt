Notes on getting tox to work:

Needed to install tox and pyenv.

On my laptop, used pyenv to install various pythons, and pyenv could see
them, but `python3.x [--version]` attemts showed the system could not find
them. The system did find older 3.4 and 3.5 pythons that were prevously
installed.

Installing tox-pyenv fixed the problem, allowing tox to find the pythons.
However, it could not import the tests. Online searches indicated adding
setenv= PYTHONPATH= fixes in tox.ini would resolve the problem, but it did
not. HOWEVER, adding the following line under [testenv] in tox.ini fixed
everything:

commands = pytest {posargs:tests}

which explicitly told pytest to run the tests in the tests folder. Tox also
included tests of python itself, and I should add that path as well to the
above statement.
